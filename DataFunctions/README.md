### Overall
This sectionis not very practical but to know it is very usefull *(at least thats what the book says)*  

The idea is that constructs such as arrays, objects and such can all be replaced with basic, self evident, functions.  

These functions can even represent data.

#### The Functions
- Kestrel/Constant
- Idiot Bird/Identity
- Vireo/Vector
